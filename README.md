# backtracking_algorithm
This is an exercise in backtracking algorithm
demand:
1.Given an integer array containing digits from [0, 9], the task is to print all possible letter 
combinations that the numbers could represent. A mapping of digit to letters (just like 
on the telephone buttons) is being followed. Note that 0 and 1 do not map to any 
letters.
2.The program need to support converting the digits from 0 to 99 into letters.
